    "# what is gan ?\n",
    "# Generative Adversarial Network\n",
    "# it is a dl model that can generate new data,that looks like a real data.\n",
    "# ex => creating fake images of faces \n",
    "#  generating art,musix,text or video data augmentation in ml or dl agai  has 2 neural network that play a game against each \n",
    "#    other.\n",
    "        # 1=> generator => the generator is a neural network that creates fake data this may images text , sound it doesnt\n",
    "#                              get real data directly. instead is starts witj random noise \n",
    "                            # and its goal is the full dicriminator by generating data that looks real.\n",
    " # how does it works ?\n",
    "#  ==> input so it will take ramdom noise it will tzke 100 random numbers then for processing it passes noise \n",
    "# thorugh layers of neural network then as an output it generates a synthetic data sample\n",

    "\n",
    "# how does it work => as an input it will take a data sample in either real from dataset or fake from generator. \n",

    "#                           thinks input is real and it return 0 means fake \n",
